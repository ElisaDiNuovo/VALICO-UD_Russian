# VALICO-UD_Russian
This repository stores six texts in Italian written by Russian native speakers, paired with target hypotheses, i.e. corrected versions of learner sentences, and linguistically annotated in Universal Dependencies following VALICO-UD annotation guidelines. 

The writing of target hypotheses and the linguistic annotation was carried out by Raissa Pia Vitullo, under the supervision of Bianca Maria De Paolis. All the annotations are carried out by Raissa Pia Vitullo. The texts fr001 and fr002 have been partially revised by Elisa Di Nuovo.
The work is described in the MA degree thesis by Raissa Pia Vitullo (supervisors Prof. Cristina Bosco, Prof. Elisa Corino, and Elisa Di Nuovo).
